Parameter Searching

This is a series of files meant to help find parameters
consistent with target densities.  We use the 
algebraic solutions to the model, and then use standard
Matlab optimization routines to search through the
38-dimensional parameter space (with constraints).

Step 1a. (optional... takes about 3-4 hours to run on a modern
desktop/laptop)

>> opt_params_search

Will generate param_search_results_flux_LHS_lowHV.mat

Step 1b. (optional... takes a few minutes to run)

>> master_pipeline

Will generate ss_flux_LHS_lowHV.mat

Finally, if you do regenerate this, copy the .mat files to the
data subdirectory, one level up
